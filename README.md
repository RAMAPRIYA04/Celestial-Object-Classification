This model uses data from the Sloan Digital SKy Survey (SDSS), which includes features such as right ascension, declination, redshift, and other spectra properties. The model is trained on 10000 insstances and currently has an accuracy rate of 98.6%.

The longterm goals for this project are to 1) store the user-generated input data and use it to train the model periodically, and 2) add a feature that allos users to input images as well, so that the model can classify them.
